//! Shared relay [`Node`] used by BOTH roles: client (outgoing connects, see
//! [`crate::client::connect_host`]) and host (incoming accepts, see
//! [`crate::host::go_online`]).
//!
//! The phone is simultaneously a client and a host, and both roles derive the
//! SAME relay identity. Binding a SEPARATE `Node` per role (the previous design)
//! registered TWO UDP sockets under one device id, so the relay's `dev.addr`
//! flapped between them on every heartbeat and an INBOUND connection (another
//! device → this phone) was routed to whichever node registered last — usually a
//! client node, which has no accept loop. The host therefore never saw the
//! request: no approval popup, no session. (Verified live: the relay logged two
//! ports for one id and forwarded `Incoming` to the client node's port.)
//!
//! One shared `Arc<Node>` fixes this: a SINGLE registration → a single heartbeat
//! → a single relay address, so `next_incoming()` (host) and `connect()` (client)
//! share it and inbound connections always reach the accept loop. `Node::register`
//! spawns the heartbeat keyed on a weak ref, so the node stays alive exactly as
//! long as this `Arc` is held in managed state.
